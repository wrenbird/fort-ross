	<p><strong>Fort Ross </strong>(Russian: Форт-Росс), originally <strong>Fortress Ross </strong>(Крѣпость Россъ, tr. <i>Krepostʹ Ross</i>), is a former Russian establishment on the west coast of North America in what is now Sonoma County, California, in the United States. It was the hub of the southernmost Russian settlements in North America from 1812 to 1842. It has been the subject of archaeological investigation and is a California Historical Landmark, a National Historic Landmark, and on the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of California's <a href=“//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Ross_State_Historic_Park”>Fort Ross State Historic Park.</a></p>

	<p>Russian personnel from the Alaskan colonies initially arrived in California aboard American ships. In 1803, American ship captains already involved in the sea otter maritime fur trade in California proposed several joint venture hunting expeditions to Alexander Andreyevich Baranov, on half shares using Russian supervisors and native Alaskan hunters to hunt fur seals and otters along the Alta and Baja Californian coast. Subsequent reports by the Russian hunting parties of uncolonized stretches of coast encouraged Baranov, the Chief Administrator of the <a href=“//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-American_Company”>Russian-American Company (RAC)</a>, to consider a settlement in California north of the limit of Spanish occupation in San Francisco. In 1806 the Russian Ambassador to Japan, and RAC director Nikolay Rezanov, undertook an exploratory trade mission to California to establish a formal means of procuring food supplies in exchange for Russian goods in San Francisco. While guests of the Spanish, Rezanov's captain, Lt. Khvostov, explored and charted the coast north of San Francisco Bay and found it completely unoccupied by other European powers. Upon his return to New Archangel, Rezanov recommended to Baranov, and Emperor Aleksandr I, that a settlement be established in California.</p>

	<p><strong>Fort Ross </strong>was established by Commerce Counselor Ivan Kuskov of the Russian-American Company. In 1808 Baranov sent two ships, the <i>Kad'yak</i> and the <i>Sv. Nikolai</i>, on an expedition south to establish settlements for the RAC with instructions to bury "secret signs"(possession plaques). Kuskov, on the <i>Kad'yak</i>, was instructed to bury the plaques, with an appropriate possession ceremony, at Trinidad, Bodega Bay, and the north shore of San Francisco, indicating Russian claims to the land. After sailing into Bodega Bay in 1809 on the <i>Kad'yak</i> and returning to Novoarkhangelsk with beaver skins and 1,160 otter pelts, Baranov ordered Kuskov to return and establish an agricultural settlement in the area. After a failed attempt in 1811, Kuskov sailed the brig <i>Chirikov</i> back to Bodega Bay in March 1812, naming it the Gulf of <strong><i>Rumyantsev</i></strong> or <strong><i>Rumyantsev Bay </i></strong>(залив Румянцева, <i>Zaliv Rumyantseva</i>) in honor of the Russian Minister of Commerce Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantzev. He also named the <a href=“//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_River_(California)”>Russian River </a> <i>the Slav </i>(Славянка, <i>Slavyanka</i>). On his return, Kuskov found American otter hunting ships and otter now scarce in Bodega Bay. After exploring the area they ended up selecting a place 15 miles (24 km) north that the native <strong>Kashaya Pomo </strong> people  called <i>Mad shui nui</i> or <i>Metini. Metini,</i> the seasonal home of the native <strong>Kashaya Pomo </strong>people, had a modest anchorage and abundant natural resources and would become the Russian settlement of Fortress Ross.</p>
